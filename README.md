# Food Services Opportunity Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Shaun, Sales Director of the Food Services Division at a major Food & Beverages Manufacturer, is preparing for an upcoming annual conference. He wants to identify **growth opportunities beyond existing restaurant customers** by analyzing external spend data.  

The dataset provided includes:
1. **Restaurants** – Total spend across F&B categories and % share of purchases from Shaun’s company.  
2. **Non-Commercial Establishments** – Hospitals, schools, and other institutions across geographies.  
3. **Retail Outlets** – Retail presence in similar geographies (context only, as retail is managed by another division).  

Shaun’s charter for the analysis:
- Get a quick view of share of total spends and F&B spends for existing restaurant customers.  
- Identify adjacent opportunities in the non-commercial segment (currently untapped).  
- Understand retailer presence near customers/prospects to gauge met vs unmet opportunities.  
- Deliver insights that are **simple, intuitive, and geographically granular**, telling a clear story of where the biggest opportunities lie.

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize spend share, adjacent opportunities, and retailer context.

## 🔑 Executive Insights

### 1. Current Customer Spend & Share
- **Total customer spend:** $177M  
- **Company captured spend:** $86.52M  
- **Share of wallet:** ~49%  
- **Uncaptured opportunity:** $90.35M (nearly equal to current captured spend).  
- **Top states:** Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Racine, Kenosha show high spend with room to grow.

### 2. Category Breakdown
- **Beverages** dominate at 33.3% of spend.  
- **Protein (20.1%)** and **Frozen (13.4%)** are the next largest categories.

### 3. Menu Type Insights

- These align with large QSR chains (McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, Subway).  
- **Opportunity:** Tailored category offerings (e.g., beverage bundles for pizza chains, protein for burger chains).

---

### 4. Top Customers
- Major chains: McDonald’s, Starbucks, Wendy’s, Subway, Burger King.  
- **Risk:** Heavy reliance on a few large chains.

- Majority are **academic institutions (71%)** with meal volumes of 101–250/day.  
- **Current penetration:** Zero.
