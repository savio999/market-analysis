# Food Services Opportunity Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Shaun, Sales Director of the Food Services Division at a major Food & Beverages Manufacturer, is preparing for an upcoming annual conference. He wants to identify **growth opportunities beyond existing restaurant customers** by analyzing external spend data.  

The dataset provided includes:
1. **Restaurants** – Total spend across F&B categories and % share of purchases from Shaun’s company.  
2. **Non-Commercial Establishments** – Hospitals, schools, and other institutions across geographies.  
3. **Retail Outlets** – Retail presence in similar geographies (context only, as retail is managed by another division).  

Shaun’s charter for the analysis:
- Get a quick view of share of total spends and F&B spends for existing restaurant customers.  
- Identify adjacent opportunities in the non-commercial segment (currently untapped).  
- Understand retailer presence near customers/prospects to gauge met vs unmet opportunities.  
- Deliver insights that are **simple, intuitive, and geographically granular**, telling a clear story of where the biggest opportunities lie.
